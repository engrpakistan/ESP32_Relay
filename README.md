This repo is about a small demo of home automation.This project will use ESP32 and a 2 channel relay module.To control switching of the relay module a stunning web server is designed and uploaded on ESP32.In return esp32 gives an IP address.
Copy the IP address and paste on any device that have a web browser.The web server will be revealed on the device and than you may control anything in my case I controlled a fan and studio lights.
